# cotswoldsmaids

This mockup / project is attributed to and based on "We are Broadway" at  Code Academy - and modified to suit my own project.  I like the clean layout and the interesting header / feature.
This project is worked on front-end and css code and will be hosted on Google when it is finished.  It is in the early stages of design modification and content.
